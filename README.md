# Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide (JavaScript to Python)

This repository is a personal project aimed at converting all the JavaScript examples from **[Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)** into Python. The book is an excellent introduction to functional programming concepts, and this project seeks to bridge its knowledge to Python enthusiasts.

## Purpose
The main goals are to:
- Enhance my understanding of functional programming by translating examples into Python.
- Provide a Python-based version of the examples for Python developers who want to explore these concepts.

## Structure
The repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter covered in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebooks will include:
1. Python translations of JavaScript examples from the book.
2. Explanatory notes to clarify key concepts and their Python implementations.

Example structure:
chapters/ 
    ├── chapter-01.ipynb 
    ├── chapter-02.ipynb 
    ├── chapter-03.ipynb
    ...
